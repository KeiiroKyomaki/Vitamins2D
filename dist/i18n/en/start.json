        "p_typically": "Typically Live2d rendering softwares calculate and wrap raw data into Live2D standard input parameters for the user to calibrate and use. However, With this processing, the actual range of blendshapes involved in the calculation is completely unknown because of individual differences, and the impact of this uncertainty is likely to be magnified when the user calibrates later.",
        "p_instead": "Instead, Vitamins calibrate the original blendshapes directly before the calculation begins.Â The goal of this calibration is the same for everyone to achieve a standardised facial expression range with a standardised calibration process.",
        "p_thiscali": "This calibration aims to allow each individual face to express each blendshapes on the full range of values, resolving problems triggered by individual differences.",
        "bq_indivi": "The same range does not mean that the individual colours disappear. Although the ranges are even, it is still up to the actor to decide how the values vary between minimum and maximum because of differences in facial muscles and expression habits.",
